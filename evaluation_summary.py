    print("1. 🔄 **Use different models**: Try Claude, GPT-4, or CodeLlama")
    print("2. 📝 **Improve prompts**: Add more specific instructions")
    print("3. 🎯 **Few-shot examples**: Include canonical solution patterns")

    print("• Your evaluation pipeline is working correctly")
    print("• Focus on improving code generation, not evaluation")
    print("• Use this as baseline to measure improvements")
